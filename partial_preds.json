This gene provides instructions for making a protein called selenium transporter 1, which plays an important role in transporting selenium from its source (the liver) into cells that need it (cells of the brain and other organs). Selenium transporters help regulate levels of this essential mineral in tissues throughout the body. The lack of functional proteins produced from the SUC16G mutation results in reduced ability to move selenium from the liver to the brain. As a result, selenium cannot be transported effectively into these tissues, leading to low levels of selenium",
